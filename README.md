## 💭 About This Project

This app marks my **first exploration into Modern UI application development**.  
While its functionality (a binary converter) is simple, it laid the foundation for me to begin creating **fully designed application concepts**.  
Through this project, I was able to **experiment with front-end design**, refine my **UI/UX sensibilities**, and connect them with a **Python backend** in a cohesive way.

I chose to make the code **publicly visible (but not open for reuse)** to contribute to my growing collection of projects and to **share my progress with others who might find inspiration** in the process.
